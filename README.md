# SpaceX Launch Tracker
### By Brayan Lozano

## Description
This website is designed to allow users to explore all SpaceX launches and view related statistics, images, and documents. The application takes advantage of SpaceX's pubicly available API to retrieve all launch data. This app was built using React.js and GraphQL. The deployment can be found [here](https://gentle-lowlands-20170.herokuapp.com/). This tutorial taught me how to use GraphQL when needing to incorporate pre-existing REST APIs. I was not able to secure enpoints using javascript web tokens but this should not take too long. I hope to learn how to integrate a MongoDB database with a GraphQL based API/backend.
